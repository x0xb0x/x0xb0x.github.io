    <p>The x0xb0x is not just another MIDI-controlled
      TB-303 clone. x0xb0x is a full reproduction of the original Roland
      synthesizer, with fully functional sequencer. The sequencer can
      be programmed just like the original 303 (ok its actually a little
      easier, we think) and can be used to control other synthesizers
      via any of its various output formats. 128 banks of track memory
      and 64 banks of pattern memory are stored in onboard EEPROM, no
      battery-backup is needed!</p>

    <p>The x0xb0x (Adafruit edition) was available as a kit that includes all
      parts necessary to build a x0xbox: PCB, case with CNC machined faceplate,
      components, buttons and knobs, AC adaptor, pre-programmed microcontroller,
      and (of course) poorly xeroxed assembly manual<a href="#asterisk">*</a>...You supplied the
      sweat &amp; tears. Adafruit has made 9 runs of 100 kits each. All but one of the components in the kit are through-hole. After a great run the project was made completely open source and we will have more updates in the month of April with what's next for our role with the x0xb0x.</p>
    <p>Because of demand and time/cost to make these kits -starting in 2005 we created a &quot;waiting list&quot; where interested kit makers could sign up to be notified if and when the next run was available for purchase.This list was a &quot;spot in line&quot; for the kits Adafruit Industries may make based on pricing, time and demand. We did not accept any payment in any form until the kit was shipped and the listee was notified to place their order with a special password for that run. This worked out great, we never &quot;held&quot; funds unless a kit was sent. The waiting list was simply a &quot;back in stock&quot; notifier for potential x0x customers.</p>
    <p>The waiting has long since been closed and no longer will be used. However, there are many suppliers that can set you up with a kit to put together.</p>

    <p>We tried a bunch of cases until we found one that
      we felt would be durable yet stylish. The x0xb0x has two CNC machined
      aluminium face places that fit into a reclosable ABS 'console' box.
      The top plate is also silkscreened. The x0xb0x is portable, but
      large enough for users to hack their own modifications in. We tried
      to put it in an altoids tin, no really, but it just wouldn't fit.</p>

    <p >We have two--count 'em, <em>two</em>--analog electrical
      engineers with too much time on their hands working on this project.
      An original TB-303 was diassembled and reverse-engineered to verify
      the schematic. The original transistors were analysed using big
      expensive curve-tracers to determine their characteristics. We measured
      every waveform and counted every cycle to give you the best sound...its
      just like the original because it IS the original.</p>

    <p>Our crazy German engineer obsessed over EVERY GODDAMN
      THING in this synth to make sure it was perfect. We sourced all
      of the original transistors and op-amps, even though it took <em>months</em>
      of harrassing people on the phone. Just deciding on which potentiometers
      to go with took three solid weeks of searching through catalogs.
      (Its a good thing he's unemployed or he would have been fired for
      not leaving the house.)</p>

    <p align="center"><em>It took us 6 months, but we tracked down the
